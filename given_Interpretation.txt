main requirements of HSS- HEIGHT SENSING SUB-SYSTEM

**Canadian-led soft landing on the Moon**- ***the height sensing subsystem (HSS) onboard***

1. subsystem will be engaged during the last 50 meters of the descent towards the
Lunar surface

2. needed to determine the current spacecraft altitiude.

3. signal to other subsystems when we have landed.

3. spacecraft has a laser altimeter sensor that can be used to compute the height of the spacecraft.

4. HSS should read the raw altimeter measurements and calculate the height.



> ## TASK DESCRIPTION :

1. Use the provided spacecraft simulator to create the height sensing subsystem.

2. For each LASER_ALTIMETER message recieved you should send a HEIGHT message containing the current spacecraft height in centimeters. done

3. Once you detect a landing event, send an ENGINE_CUTOFF message to indicate to all other subsystems that we have touched down.

4. Once you detect a landing event, send an ENGINE_CUTOFF message to indicate to all other subsystems that we have touched down.


The HSS should be bound to port 12778

The message bus router is bound to port 12777

For any given message type, all messages are sent in order.

Each data field in a message is byte-aligned.

Each message is broadcast to all subsystems regardless of its type.

SYSTEM DETAILS :

subsystem is executed in a *distributed context* where each communicates with the others
through the use of a message bus called MoonWire

Subsystems send data
by sending specially formatted UDP packets onto the bus.

receive data by
listening for specially formatted UDP packets on this bus from other subsystems

provided MoonWire specification to determine how to read and
send data from the message bus.

converting raw laser data into normal_one

laser altimeter :

The laser altimeter is *mounted vertically* to the underside of the lander
spacecraft

the laser altimeter is approximately *40 cm* above the ground. so the ACTUAL height(INCLUDING LEGS) from the moon surface is [40cm + reading from the laser altimeter]
BUT ASSUME HEIGHT = HEIGHT OF SPACE CRAFT
SO==> LANDING CAN BE DETECTED WHEN HEIGHT == 40 CM 

The altimeter instrument has 3 sensing heads on it and will therefore
produces 3 measurements each time it is sampled.


The laser altimiter has a max range of 1000 meters and will produces readings from 0 to
65535 (UINT16_MAX).


16-bit
integers and must be scaled to determine the true height in meters. The laser
altimiter has a max range of 1000 meters and will produces readings from 0 to
65535 (UINT16_MAX).

To implement the height sensing susbsytem, you may use any suitable language/
runtime. You should not use any external libraries in your implementation
(POSIX APIs are allowed). The flight computer runs Linux on an x86_64
processor and the subsystem must run on this target. Youâ€™re expected to state
all assumptions and justify design decisions. Examples include your choices of
language, program structure, and algorithms. Also include any documentation
required to setup your software.
